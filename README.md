Nextjs learning application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that uses the [next auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) library to perform user authentication.

Through this project I was able to improve my skills in developing web applications with Nextjs, taking advantage of features such as server-side rendering and authentication with NextAuth.

External libs: [react-hook-form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/), [react-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction).
